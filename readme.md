# AYIM SB Metrics
Script to help analyze and find metric data related to storyboards for MCA/AYIM for osu!.

This project requires at least Python 3.6.

## Dependencies
Only external dependency is `progressbar2`.

You will need to provide your own maps inside a `maps` directory. The script will currently only look for .osz files. There is no need to extract the .osz files to folders.

## TODO
- Get more maps.
- Check for missing maps (there were no exceptions, fortunately)
- Implement SB metric understanding
    - Brainstorming is probably needed for this
